# User Design Specification:

Unblock’s operates around two complementary pillars of design: a nice UI and a fun virtual pet. The implementation of these features is designed to allow our app to easily become an enjoyable part of someone’s day which will hopefully help them achieve their goals.

The home screen of Unblock’d aims to place all of the most important aspects of our app right in front of the user. The main screen mostly shows the tasks the user has created, the virtual pet they customized, and the option for creating new tasks. The new task form is something which required a lot of time and attention. It allows the user to specify a task’s name, days to be reminded, time for first reminder, and how long before the set time you want the reminder to appear. All of these features had to be sent to the database and retrieved in order to reflect on the home screen.

The other core feature of our app was the ability to create and customize a virtual pet. Our hope was that in doing this we would make interacting with our app a more naturally fun experience. We allow the user to create either a cat dog or bird, and then give them the option of a certain kind of cosmetic to apply. This cosmetic is applied on top of the animal and displayed on the home screen. In our demo, this resulted in a dog with a cowboy hat named “Gus” being displayed on the home screen of our app. 

Based on the combination of these features, we hope the design of our app makes it fun and gratifying to use.
