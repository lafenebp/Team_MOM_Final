# Abstract: 
Unblock’d is an app designed to use a fun and fluid user experience to transform the process of becoming your best self from a dull drag to an engaging and rewarding process. We aim to achieve this goal through two pillars of design: a clean UI which places all the user’s most important functions right at their fingertips, and a customizable and fun virtual pet which gives users a friendly face to greet them when they interact with the app. 


# Description 

We are designing our app from the ground up to be a friendly experience for its users. Our hope is that users will come to the application wanting to change their habits and better their lives and we want to provide something to help them along the way.

In our early research stage, we came to the conclusion that a lot of apps which are geared towards helping people improve their lives have a lot of limitations. For one thing, most apps in the marketplace today have a UI which does not feel very fluid to the user. When designing an application to help modify behavior instead of just rewarding it, it is important to let users take essential actions in very few clicks. If users feel like updating their completion of tasks or making new tasks is a frustrating process, they will do it less. We are also going to take steps to ensure that the calendar view which serves as the user's home screen in our app will be clutter free at all times. We aim to accomplish this in part by only offering two calendar views: daily and weekly.

Another area in which we seek to improve on the competition is through the implementation of a virtual pet. Examples of virtual pets becoming ingrained in peoples' lives are common throughout our modern history. Pokemon Go became the most successful app to ever launch overnight when it was released in 2015, and the Tamagotchi keychain craze of the 90's was a long running pop culture sensation. These inventions have two big things in common. They both asked users to care for cute and lovable animals and they both feature pretty low amounts of interactivity. Our hope is to preserve the cute aspect of this idea while allowing the pet to encourage users to make better habits. Our hope is that users will schedule activities they want to do ahead of time, and when the time comes to complete that action the animal will start behaving similarly to how the user should. Our hope is to create a "mirrored behavior" affect in users and make them feel more compelled to act as they previously stated they should.

We hope this combination of fluid UI and pet implementation will make our app compelling enough for users to implement into their lives.
